# Contributing to PojavLauncher itself 
I'm relatively new to using PojavLauncher, and I'm interested in the project. I'd like to contribute an idea that could improve user convenience. There's an open-source launcher called PrismLauncher, and it has a very useful feature, which is to create multiple instances of different versions of Minecraft, each with its own mods or loaders. It would be very useful if some of those features were integrated into PojavLauncher, allowing for two different worlds with different mods, one running on Forge and the other on Fabric, for example.

I love this launcher, keep up the good work. I hope to contribute more in the future, either with ideas or financially. Thank you and good night.
